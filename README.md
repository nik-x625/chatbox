## Features

*   **Interactive Chat Interface:** Clean and user-friendly chat UI.
*   **Real-time Updates (with HTMX):** Leverages HTMX for dynamic content updates without full page reloads, making interactions smooth and fast.
*   **Responsive Design (with Bootstrap):** Adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
*   **Easy Backend Integration:** Designed with Flask integration in mind, but adaptable to other Python backend frameworks.
*   **Minimal Dependencies:** Relies on well-established frontend libraries.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the chat interface.
*   **HTMX:** For handling AJAX requests and updating parts of the page dynamically.
*   **Bootstrap 5:** For styling and responsive design components.
*   **JavaScript (Optional):** Can be used for additional client-side logic if needed.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

No complex prerequisites are needed for the frontend components. You'll need a web browser to view the HTML files.

If you plan to integrate this with a Flask backend, you will need:

*   Python 3.x
*   Flask

```bash
pip install Flask
```

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repository-url.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd chatbox
    ```
3.  Open the `index.html` (or relevant HTML file) in your browser to see the frontend.

## Usage with Flask

To integrate this chatbot frontend with a Flask backend:

1.  **Set up your Flask application:**
    Create a `app.py` file (or your preferred structure).

    ```python
    from flask import Flask, render_template, request

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        return render_template('index.html') # Assuming your main chat HTML is index.html

    @app.route('/send_message', methods=['POST'])
    def send_message():
        user_message = request.form.get('user_message')
        # Process the user_message with your chatbot logic
        # bot_response = your_chatbot_function(user_message)
        bot_response = f"You said: {user_message}" # Placeholder response

        # Return the bot's response, formatted as HTMX expects
        # This might be an HTML snippet to append to the chat.
        return f"""
        <div class="mb-2">
            <div class="bg-light p-2 rounded text-dark text-end">
                {user_message}
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-2">
            <div class="bg-primary p-2 rounded text-white">
                {bot_response}
            </div>
        </div>
        """ # Example HTMX response

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```

2.  **Ensure your HTML form (using HTMX) points to the Flask endpoint:**
    In your HTML, the form submission should be handled by HTMX, targeting an endpoint like `/send_message`.

    ```html
    <!-- Example HTMX form in your chat HTML -->
    <form hx-post="/send_message" hx-target="#chat-output" hx-swap="beforeend">
        <input type="text" name="user_message" class="form-control" placeholder="Type your message...">
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary mt-2">Send</button>
    </form>

    <div id="chat-output">
        <!-- Chat messages will be appended here by HTMX -->
    </div>
    ```

3.  **Run your Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    Then open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
